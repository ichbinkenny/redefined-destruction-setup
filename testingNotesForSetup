The following is a collection of notes for the setup script:
1. Client vs Server detection works!
2. Only proper packages for the client or server are installed based on selection.
3. Proper service files are transfered and setup for run on system boot!
4. Network ID set for server sticks between reboots!
5. Battle bot ID is visible on the device name via bluetooth!

In short, everything appears to be working as intended!
